# JawApp

This is a collection of front-ends running off of a Firebase backend with the intended goal of running the absolute simplest instant messaging system. In a world where applications are getting more and more complicated with a billion features in them the JawApp is built with a simpler, minimalistic, vision. The goal is to have Android, iOS, and Web clients so that the simple messaging experience can be shared across most devices. 

## Getting Started

There are different development environment needs depending on which part of the project you are working on:

### Android
For the JawAndroid project:

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. Request [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) permissions
3. Generate a google-services.json file from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
4. Copy the json file from step 3 into /JawApp/JawAndroid/app
5. VÃ²la you should be able to run the Android application (either by an emulator or a connected device)

### Web
For the JawWeb project:
1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (different depending on your OS)
2. Install the Firebase CLI tools by running ```npm -g install firebase-tools```
3. Authorize the Firebase CLI by running ```firebase login```
4. Make sure you are in the JawWeb directory then run ```firebase use --add``` and set the alias to your branch name

To run the nodejs project in the local environment run ```firebase serve``` from the JawWeb project. You should be able to see the project at ```localhost:5000```
